# DiffStock-TUI

**DiffStock-TUI** is a high-performance Terminal User Interface (TUI) application built in Rust for probabilistic stock price forecasting. It combines real-time market data ingestion with Monte Carlo simulations to generate "Cones of Uncertainty," helping traders visualize potential future price paths and risk levels.

## Features

*   **Real-Time Data**: Fetches daily OHLCV data directly from Yahoo Finance.
*   **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Generates 50-day forward simulations using Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) based on historical volatility and drift.
*   **Cone of Uncertainty**: Visualizes risk with P10, P30, P50 (Median), P70, and P90 percentile paths.
*   **Technical Analysis**: Automatically calculates and displays Support, Resistance, and Pivot points.
*   **Interactive TUI**: Fast, keyboard-driven interface built with `ratatui`.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
*   Rust and Cargo (latest stable version)
*   A terminal with TrueColor support (e.g., Alacritty, iTerm2, Windows Terminal)

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sudorambo/diffstock-tui.git
cd diffstock-tui
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be located in `target/release/diffstock-tui`.

## Usage

Run the application:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

1.  **Input**: Type a valid stock ticker symbol (e.g., `NVDA`, `AAPL`, `TSLA`) and press `Enter`.
2.  **Analysis**: View the historical chart, technical levels, and the probabilistic forecast cone.
3.  **Controls**:
    *   `Enter`: Fetch data for the typed symbol.
    *   `r`: Reset the search.
    *   `q` or `Esc`: Quit the application.

## Architecture

*   **Language**: Rust
*   **UI Framework**: [Ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui)
*   **Async Runtime**: Tokio
*   **HTTP Client**: Reqwest (with Rustls)
*   **Math/Stats**: Rand, Rand_Distr

## Roadmap

*   [ ] Integration with PyTorch/Candle for Transformer-based Diffusion models.
*   [ ] Configurable forecast horizons and simulation counts.
*   [ ] Additional technical indicators (RSI, MACD).
*   [ ] Portfolio simulation mode.
